        <span class="fonty"><ion-icon ios="ios-arrow-forward" md="md-arrow-dropright"></ion-icon> Coaching</span> is a series of conversations intended to facilitate personal growth. 
        The best coaches enlighten with their questions, not their advice. They know the 
        ‘best’ answer lies within you, and that your discovery of it significantly increases 
        the chances you will actually do something about it. LeaderCOACH facilitates translating 
        insight into action. Give yourself the time to reflect on the questions, and let that lead 
        you where you need to go. In short, trust the process.
