    <ul>
      <li><p><span class="fonty">LeaderCOACH®</span> begins by asking what you essentially want to do: coach yourself, coach someone or lead a meeting. There are
      33 different modules (or goals) from which to choose. You choose how much time to devote to the session, and what your objective
      is within that time frame. (This increases intentionality and improves your chance of success.)
      </p></li>
      <li><p>
          <span class="fonty">LeaderCOACH</span> gives you the option to prepare for the session by prompting you with questions to reflect on, ultimately producing
        a percent likelihood of success
      </p></li>
      <li><p>
          <span class="fonty">LeaderCOACH</span> starts with a preview of the proposed timing (which you can adjust) organized into an agenda with timed phases
        (each of which you can adjust). Once accepted, the first phase begins. Each phase begins with a statement of intent for that
        phase, then presents the first question. Swipe left to get the next question, or let auto-advance move you to the next question.
        (You may disable auto-advance, and hide the timer if you wish.)
      </p></li>
      <li><p>
          <span class="fonty">LeaderCOACH</span> questions are merely launching pads from which to explore a perspective. You choose how prescriptively to use
        the questions. Put them into your own words. Ask related questions, but be careful not to jump to another phase/ perspective
        with your question. Once a phase has been fully explored, you can advance to the next phase—or return to a previous phase.
        The result is an efficient, 360-degree view of your subject.
      </p></li>
      <li><p>
         A post-critique of your session is optional. Questions prompt you to reflect on what went well, and what you’d do differently
        next time. If you know your Myers-Briggs® type code, <span class="fonty">LeaderCOACH</span> will produce pie charts of how it would predict you spent
        time in the session (by phase), your actual time spent, and the ideal (an equal balance).
      </p></li>
    </ul>
