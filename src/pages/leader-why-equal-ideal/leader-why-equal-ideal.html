        <ion-icon ios="ios-arrow-forward" md="md-arrow-dropright"></ion-icon> Carl Jung theorized that 1 of these 4 functions predominates in your personality, 
        and another plays a supporting role; the other 2 functions remain largely untapped. 
        (Think of your personality as a pie chart: 47% is your dominant role (color); 30% is 
        your supporting actor; 17% is your third-rate function, and 7% is your least accessed 
        and developed part.)  Consequently, we tend to see things from our unique, yet limited 
        point of view, and tend to explore only 2, maybe 3, of the 4 perspectives; hence, the 
        need for a holistic view of a situation or issue.

        Carl Jung said, For complete orientation (understanding) all four functions should 
        <span class="contributeStyle">contribute equally:</span>  
    </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
            <span class="coloredBlue fonty">Thinking</span> should facilitate cognition and judgment,
        </li>
        <li>
            <span class="coloredRed fonty">Feeling</span> should tell us how and to what extent a thing is important or unimportant to us, 
        </li>
        <li>
            <span class="coloredGreen fonty">Sensing</span> should convey concrete reality to us through seeing, hearing, tasting, etc., and 
        </li>
        <li>
            <span class="coloredYellow fonty">Intuition</span> should enable us to divine the hidden possibilities in the background, since these too belong to the complete picture of a given situation. 
        </li>
      </ul>
    <p>
      From his work with patients, Jung realized that each color was correlated with a particular function 
      of oneâ€™s personality; hence, the use of these colors.
