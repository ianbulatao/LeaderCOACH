    <h2 class="infoHead">Why these colors?</h2><hr>
    <p>
      <ion-icon ios="ios-arrow-forward" md="md-arrow-dropright"></ion-icon>The 4 colors represent 4 perspectives or ways of knowing. Carl Jung, the Swiss psychiatrist, 
      referred to these as functions of one’s personality. Each contributes to overall understanding:
    </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
            <span class="coloredGreen fonty">Sensing (green)</span> grasps what is…what is currently happening or has happened, 
            as perceived by the senses, typically in specific, concrete or literal terms;
        </li>
        <li>
            <span class="coloredYellow fonty">Intuition (yellow)</span> infers what possibilities may ensue from what is, wondering 
            where it came from, where it’s going, and what it potentially means;
        </li>
        <li>
            <span class="coloredRed fonty">Feeling (red)</span> determines its value, desirability or appropriateness, evaluating 
            to what extent ‘it’ is in harmony with group norms or personal values; 
        </li>
        <li>
            <span class="coloredBlue fonty">Thinking (blue)</span> judges its clarity, correctness or reasonableness against 
            objective criteria, and identifies logical consequences and next steps.
        </li>
      </ul>
    <p>
      From his work with patients, Jung realized that each color was correlated with a particular function 
      of one’s personality; hence, the use of these colors.
